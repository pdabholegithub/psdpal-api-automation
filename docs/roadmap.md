## 🗺️ PSDPAL API Automation – Roadmap

A strategic, milestone-driven roadmap for evolving the PSDPAL API Automation Framework into an enterprise-ready, 
scalable, CI/CD-integrated platform.

## ✅ Phase 1 – Completed

Core foundation features have been implemented successfully:
✔ Multi-environment support (-Denv)
✔ ConfigReader & single properties file
✔ Basic GET/POST API test flows
✔ Token generation & session handling
✔ Central APIClient + RequestBuilder
✔ Modular folder structure (ReqRes + RestfulBooker)
✔ Framework banner + metadata loading
✔ Initial reusable validations (status, JSON)

🎉 Framework foundation is stable and ready for expansion.

## 🚧 Phase 2 – In Progress

Current focus is on strengthening test coverage and reliability:
🚧 JSON Schema validation for each endpoint
🚧 Parallel execution (TestNG + thread-safe utilities)
🚧 Retry logic for flaky APIs
🚧 Enhanced response validators (headers, time, structure)
🚧 Detailed error logging + execution context data

🔄 These improvements increase accuracy and reduce test flakiness.

## 🚀 Phase 3 – Upcoming Enhancements

High-impact features planned for the next major iteration:
🚀 Allure Reporting (HTML dashboard + trends)
🚀 CI/CD pipeline setup with Jenkins
🚀 Slack / Teams / Webhook notifications
🚀 API Mocking with WireMock (negative scenarios)
🚀 OAuth2 / JWT / Session Refresh automation
🚀 Request & Response Interceptors
🚀 Test-data generators (faker, templates)

✨ This phase elevates the framework into a production-ready test platform.

## 🔮 Phase 4 – Long-Term Vision

Strategic, future-focused goals for the framework:
🔮 Full API regression suite (ReqRes + RestfulBooker + future APIs)
🔮 Visual API analytics dashboard (Grafana / Allure Trends)
🔮 Automatic endpoint coverage reporting
🔮 Contract Testing (OpenAPI / Pact)
🔮 Load testing integration (JMeter or Gatling)
🔮 Self-service API test runner for team members
🌟 This is the path toward an enterprise-grade API quality ecosystem.
